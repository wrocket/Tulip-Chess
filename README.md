Tulip-Chess
===========

Purpose
-------
This is a chess engine written for my own amusement. Not designed to be the absolute strongest, but rather a fun programming project. The current goal is play strength >= 2000 ELO.

Requirements
------------
The application is intended to be built on any UNIX-ish system using a GCC-like C compiler.

Principles
----------
* Tulip should be reasonably self-contained. The only dependencies should be standard POSIX headers and programs supplied by the OS.
* Tulip should be readily portable to any UNIX-like system.
* Tulip should be buildable with a one-step invocation of 'make'.
